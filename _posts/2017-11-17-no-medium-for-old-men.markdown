Since I like to add tons of footnotes<sup>[1](#footnote)</sup>, `code highlight` and other weird stuff that maybe too old to new media,
to put a site for notes seems like a footgun more gentle than others.

Oh, the first hurting wound hit by it is, ironically, the footer. The duplicated titles of the site looks stupid, but I don't want to waste one hour for picking a theme; the power of default option, I think.

Maybe the second one is I need to find where to put CC license for all posts, rather to copy and paste this again and again:

<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png" /></a>

<a name="footnote">1</a>: Once I wrote a blog article has [that footnotes are longer than the main body][1]. I think I need some help for keeping information tidy and organised in article body.
